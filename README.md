# public

This repository holds all of my public projects, whether through course work or personal projects.

Below you will find a brief description of each of the projects in this repository.  

(1) Langton's Ant: This is an early project that demonstrates two-dimensional array usage with Langton's Ant.
                   it is also the first attempt at a simple menu. All done in C++.  
                  
(2) Rock, Paper, Scissors: This was a group effort that is the first demonstration of polymorphism and inheritance in C++.

(3) Fantasy Dice Game: This light-hearted dice game is a demonstration of not only polymorphism and inheritance, but
                       the first time I needed to coordniate more than a dozen different files into a cohesive program in C++.
                       
(4) Text Survival Game: The culmination of an OSU class, this text based game demonstrates the usage of polymorphism 
                        along with pointers in C++.                   
                        
(5) Weather: This no-frill single page website demonstrates using AJAX for GET & POST requests.  It uses a GET request to
             access the Open Weather API using either a city's Zip Code or the city name.  It also does an asynchronous 
             POST request.  This is all done using Javascript and HTML.
        
(6) GET & POST: This is an early backend project that simply checks to see if a request was a GET or a POST request and displays it. 
                This uses JavaScript, HTML and Node.js.  

(7) DOM Traveral: A simple demonstration of traversing the DOM and setting up events in JavaScript. 

(8) Automobile: This JavaScript project uses higher order functions and objects.  It should be started using Node.js.  It will print to the console.  

(9) Procedure & Loops: This MASM project demonstrates basic usage of loops and
procedures within MASM. It also validates the user's input.  This uses the Irvine Library.  

(10) Indirect Addressing: Demonstrates indirect addressing and passing parameters in MASM, along with generating "random" numbers and working with arrays.  This uses the Irvine Library.

(11) Low-level IO: Creating and using low-level I/O procedures and macros. It gets 10 integers from the user, displays them, their sum and their average. Uses the Irvine Library.

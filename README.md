# public

This repository holds all of my public projects, whether through course work or personal projects.

Below you will find a brief description of each of the projects in this repository.  

(1) Langton's Ant: This is an early project that demonstrates two-dimensional array usage with Langton's Ant.
                   it is also the first attempt at a simple menu. All done in C++.  
                  
(2) Rock, Paper, Scissors: This was a group effort that is the first demonstration of polymorphism and inheritance in C++.

(3) Fantasy Dice Game: This light-hearted dice game is a demonstration of not only polymorphism and inheritance, but
                       the first time I needed to coordniate more than a dozen different files into a cohesive program in C++.
                       
(4) Text Survival Game: The culmination of an OSU class, this text based game demonstrates the usage of polymorphism 
                        along with pointers in C++.  

(5) Weather: This no-frill single page website demonstrates using AJAX for GET & POST requests.  It uses a GET request to
             access the Open Weather API using either a city's Zip Code or the city name.  It also does an asynchronous 
             POST request.  This is all done using Javascript and HTML.
